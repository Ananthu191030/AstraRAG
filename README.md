# 🧠 AstraRAG: A Generative AI System with RAG and AI Agents
AstraRAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Generative AI system built as part of my learning journey through the Complete Generative AI: RAG, AI Agents & Deployment course.
This project focuses on exploring AI agents, RAG pipelines, and containerized deployments to understand how modern intelligent systems work end-to-end.

🚀 Features
🧩 RAG Pipeline — Enhances LLM responses using document retrieval from a vector database (ChromaDB)
🤖 AI Agents (CrewAI) — Multi-agent system for task coordination and reasoning
⚡ FastAPI Backend — High-performance API layer to serve AI responses
💬 Streamlit UI — Interactive interface to chat and visualize responses
🐳 Docker Integration — Fully containerized environment for easy setup and portability
🦙 LlamaIndex Integration — RAG framework for indexing and context-aware response generation
🧠 Groq LLM Integration — Fast inference and efficient large language model handling
